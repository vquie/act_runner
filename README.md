# act-runner Docker Image

This is my own draft of the act-runner in docker. It expects a docker daemon on `tcp://localhost:2375`
and is therefore able to run in a k8s DinD environment. Please see the [helm chart](https://gitea.com/vquie/act_runner-helm).

```
docker pull vqui/act_runner:latest
```
